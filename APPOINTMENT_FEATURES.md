## Authentication & Security

### Access Control

- Doctors can only see history of their own patients
- Admin has full access for management purposes

## Backward Compatibility

### Existing Data Support
- New `patientId` field is optional
- Existing appointments without `patientId` are handled via `patientEmail`
- All existing functionality remains intact

### Migration Strategy
- No database migration required
- New appointments will include `patientId`
- Existing appointments continue to work with `patientEmail`

## Usage Examples

### For Doctors
1. Navigate to Doctor Dashboard
2. Click "History" button next to any patient name
3. View complete medical history in modal
4. See all past appointments, symptoms, medicines, etc.
